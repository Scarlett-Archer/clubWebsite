# Club Website üèì

This project is a website for a local padel club. Please note, the membership page still needs to be completed. 
I enjoyed co-ordinating the colour scheme to make it a vibrant, professional looking site.

## Technologies

I applied HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this website. 

* CSS positioning was applied to fix a section of the nav bar to the top of the page.
* CSS flexbox was used to organise the content on the page. 
* I incorporated javascript to create some interactivity for when the user submits their details on the form.
* Responsive design has also been applied.
